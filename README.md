## üß© Data Structures Used

This project utilizes the following data structures, each chosen for specific purposes:

- **Array**  
  Fixed-size collection stored in contiguous memory. Used for fast random access when size is known.

- **Dynamic Array (`List<T>`)**  
  Resizable array allowing flexible sizing with fast access.

- **Singly Linked List**  
  Each node points to the next node. Efficient for fast insertions/deletions at the front and sequential access.

- **Doubly Linked List**  
  Nodes link both forward and backward. Allows fast insertions/deletions at both ends and bidirectional traversal.

- **Stack**  
  Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) structure. Useful for undo operations, backtracking, and expression parsing.

- **Queue**  
  First-In, First-Out (FIFO) structure. Ideal for task scheduling and breadth-first search.

- **Priority Queue**  
  Processes elements based on priority. Used in scheduling and pathfinding.

- **Hash Table**  
  Key-value pairs with fast lookup for quick search, insertion, and deletion.

- **Tree (Binary Search Tree)**  
  Hierarchical data structure supporting sorted data and efficient search.

- **Graph**  
  Nodes connected by edges, used to model networks or complex relationships.

## üìê Algorithms Used

This project implements the following algorithms:

- **Linear Search**  
  Checks elements one by one.

- **Binary Search**  
  Efficient search on sorted arrays.

- **Interpolation Search**  
  An advanced search algorithm for **uniformly distributed sorted arrays** that estimates the position of the target based on its value relative to the bounds, potentially reducing the number of probes compared to binary search.

- **Bubble Sort**

- **Bubble Sort**  
  Swaps adjacent elements repeatedly.

- **Selection Sort**  
  Finds the smallest element and places it correctly.

- **Insertion Sort**  
  Builds the sorted array one item at a time.

- **Merge Sort**  
  Divide and conquer sorting algorithm.

- **Quick Sort**  
  Efficient sorting using a pivot.

- **Stack-based Expression Evaluation**  
  Evaluates expressions using a stack.

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
  Graph traversal using a queue.

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**  
  Graph traversal using recursion or stack.

- **Balanced Parentheses Checker**  
  Verifies matching brackets using a stack.

- **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm**  
  Finds the shortest path in a graph.

- **Backtracking**  
  Solves constraint problems like puzzles.
