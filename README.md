## Data Structures Used

This project utilizes the following data structures, each chosen for specific purposes:

- **Array**  
  Fixed-size collection stored in contiguous memory. Used for fast random access when size is known.

- **Dynamic Array (`List<T>`)**  
  Resizable array allowing flexible sizing with fast access.

- **Singly Linked List**  
  Each node points to the next node. Efficient for fast insertions/deletions at the front and sequential access.

- **Doubly Linked List**  
  Nodes link both forward and backward. Allows fast insertions/deletions at both ends and bidirectional traversal.

- **Stack**  
  Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) structure. Useful for undo operations, backtracking, and expression parsing.

- **Queue**  
  First-In, First-Out (FIFO) structure. Ideal for task scheduling and breadth-first search.

- **Priority Queue**  
  Processes elements based on priority. Used in scheduling and pathfinding.

- **Hash Table**  
  Key-value pairs with fast lookup for quick search, insertion, and deletion.

- **Tree (Binary Search Tree)**  
  Hierarchical data structure supporting sorted data and efficient search.

- **Graph**  
  Nodes connected by edges, used to model networks or complex relationships.
