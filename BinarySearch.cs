// Binary Search is an efficient searching algorithm
// It works on sorted arrays or lists by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half
// If the target value is less than the middle element, search the left half
// Otherwise, search the right half, until the target is found or the interval is empty

// Time Complexity:
// Best Case: O(1) (target found at middle position)
// Worst Case: O(log n) (target not found or found after multiple divisions)
// Average Case: O(log n)
